About Me
======
Hello! I am a Research Assistant at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhiqiang Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DGr0fVoAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also working with [Dr.Gen Luo](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=EyZqU9gAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at Shanghai AI Lab and [Prof. Rongrong Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lRSD7PQAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I graduated from Technical University of Denmark supervised by [Prof. Dim P. Papadopoulos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-_JAhdQAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests span in :
- **Multimodal Foundation Model**: Developing native multimodal foundation models or agents which can perform both understanding and generation tasks from video,language.
- **Efficient deep learning**: I am interested in how to train or inference large models more efficiently, especially tackling the sparsity nature of nerual networks.
