About Me
======
Hello! I am a First-Year Machine Learning PhD student at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), advised by [Prof. Zhiqiang Shen](https://zhiqiangshen.com/), [Dr.Fabio Pizzati](https://fabvio.github.io/) and [Prof.Ivan Laptev](https://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/) . I am also closely working with my friend [Xiaofu Chen](https://xxfchen.github.io/XiaofuChen/). Previously, I was a Research Assistant at MBZUAI and received my Bachelor's degree from [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english/) supervised by [Prof. Dim P. Papadopoulos](https://dimipapa.github.io/). My research interests span in :
- **Multimodal Foundation Model / World Model**: Developing native multimodal foundation models which can perform  **understanding**, **reasoning**, **generation** tasks from video,language, speech. These models will serve as the core intelligenceâ€”the "brain"â€”for Embodied AI, Robotics, and many other applications. **(My Long-Term research interest and belief)**
- **Reinforcement Learning**: I study reinforcement learning on top of pretrained and SFT-initialized models to move beyond imitationâ€”unlocking new capabilities in generative modeling and robotics, including training agents inside learned world-model environments.
- ** Data-centric Machine Learning**: Analysis and Understanding the training data of the model, improve the data quality, compress the data for training efficiency, scalable and cheap data pipline for curating or synthesis high quality training data. 

News
======
- Recently, I am focusing on developing physical law obeyed Video Generation Foundation Model using RL post-training techniques.
