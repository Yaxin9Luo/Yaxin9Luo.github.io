About Me
======
Hello! I am a Machine Learning PhD student at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhiqiang Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DGr0fVoAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also working on **InternVL** Related Projects as a Research Intern at OpenGVLab, Shanghai Ai Lab. I am also closely working with my mentor [Dr.Gen Luo](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=EyZqU9gAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and my friend [Xiaofu Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dks3OoUAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree from Technical University of Denmark supervised by [Prof. Dim P. Papadopoulos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-_JAhdQAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests span in :
- **Multimodal Foundation Model**: Developing native multimodal foundation models which can perform both understanding and generation tasks from video,language. **(My Long-Term never changed research interest and belief)**
- **Efficient deep learning**: I am interested in how to train or inference large models more efficiently, especially tackling the sparsity nature of nerual networks. **(Support the first goal)**
- **Multimodal Agents**: Innovate easy to use Multimodal Agents to automate complicated real-world complex tasks. **(Support the first goal)**
