Research Interests  
My long-term goal is to develop intelligent machines capable of perceiving, understanding, and creating multimodal content, such as videos. This includes multimodal 
machine learning, vision foundation models, and also efficient algorithms for foundational models. Recently, I am focusing on MLLM Agent, Especially, Tool 
Integrated Reasoning Training MLLM using Reinforcement Learning to equip the model with reasoning and tool calling abilities to solve more complex and long 
trajectory tasks.

ICLR 2025 γ-MoD: Exploring Mixture-of-Depth Adaptation for Multimodal Large Language Models 
γ-MOD is a novel approach to enhance computational efficiency in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating Mixture-
of-Depth (MoD) layers. This plug-and-play strategy seamlessly replaces redundant dense layers, significantly reducing computational costs 
while maintaining performance. 
ECCV 2024 APL: Anchor-based Prompt Learning for One-stage Weakly Supervised Referring Expression Comprehension.  
The project focuses on developing an Anchor-based Prompt Learning (APL) method for one-stage weakly supervised Referring Expression 
Comprehension (REC). The key innovation lies in the Anchor-based Prompt Encoder (APE), which generates and fuses prompts related to 
position, color, and category into anchor features. This improves the visual description power, enhancing the weakly supervised alignment 
between vision and language. Two auxiliary losses, the text reconstruction loss and visual alignment loss, further promote better vision 
language alignment. APL demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including RefCOCO and ReferIt, with significant 
improvements in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.
